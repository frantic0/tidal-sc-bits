Developing between supercollider and tidal

###sc-dirt

In order to use sc-dirt (superdirt?), you need to select and run the three parts of the *sc-dirt*-file in supercollider (sclang) and then connect to it from tidal. There are a few tests in sclang, too. 

This code is preliminary, and doesn't implement all dirt features correctly. The aim is to make it easier to extend dirt with effects and synths not based on samples.
